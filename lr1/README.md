# Practice 1 (OOP)

Design a program in any high-level language that demonstrates the concepts of OOP and contains:

- inheritance from the abstract class;
- public and private properties and methods;
- overloaded methods;
- properties:
- simple data types (for example, string, int ...);
- reference to other objects;
- arrays / lists of simple types / objects;
- code to create objects of all classes, to populate all properties, and to call all methods.
  All classes, objects, their properties and methods have to make sense.
